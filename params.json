Our algorithm makes it possible to detect integration sites throughout the entire genome, with high sensitivity and specificity, by a rapid processing of single-end read alignments to the host genome. The method can be applied to any viruses for which the reference sequence has been established, and also to other types of transposable DNA elements.\r\n\r\nCheck out Wiki to learn how to run InSiDeR - [Wiki](https://github.com/UppsalaGenomeCenter/InSiDeR/wiki)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Ignas Bunikis, Adam Ameur\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
